Library used by PTEID
Compiles ok 

see test for example

unsigned char tmp[20];
hash_state md;
unsigned char *msg="abc";

sha1_init(&md);
sha1_process(&md, msg, (unsigned long)strlen(msg));
sha1_done(&md, tmp);
for (i=0;i<20;i++)
    printf("ox ", md[i]);


cc -c *.c
cc -o example example.c sha1.o

Better is to add to a static library
